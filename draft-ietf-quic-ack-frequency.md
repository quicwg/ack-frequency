# Introduction

The QUIC transport protocol recommends sending an ACK frame after receiving at
least two ack-eliciting packets; see {{Section 13.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.
However, the data receiver determines how frequently to send acknowledgments
in response to ack-eliciting packets, without any ability for the data sender
to influence this behavior. This document specifies an extension to
QUIC that enables an endpoint to request its peer change its behavior when sending or
delaying acknowledgments.

This document defines a new transport parameter that indicates support of this
extension and specifies two new frame types to request changes to the peer's
acknowledgement behavior.

## Terms and Definitions

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

In the rest of this document, "sender" refers to a QUIC data sender (and
acknowledgment receiver). Similarly, "receiver" refers to a QUIC data receiver
(and acknowledgment sender).

This document uses terms, definitions, and notational conventions described in
{{Section 1.2 and Section 1.3 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

# Motivation

A receiver acknowledges received packets, but can delay sending these
acknowledgments. Delaying acknowledgments can impact a data sender's
throughput, loss detection and congestion controller performance, as well
as CPU utilization at both endpoints.

Reducing the frequency of acknowledgments can improve connection and
endpoint performance in the following ways:

- Sending UDP datagrams is very CPU intensive on some platforms. A data
  receiver can decrease its CPU usage by reducing the number of
  acknowledgement-only packets sent. Experience shows that this
  reduction can be critical for high packet rate connections.

- Similarly, receiving UDP datagrams can also be CPU intensive. Reducing the
  acknowledgement frequency also reduces the data sender's CPU usage because
  it receives and processes fewer acknowledgment-only packets.

- For asymmetric link technologies, such as DOCSIS, LTE, and satellite,
  connection throughput in the forward path can become constrained
  when the reverse path is filled by acknowledgment packets {{?RFC3449}}.
  When traversing such links, reducing the number of acknowledgments can achieve
  higher connection throughput, lower the impact on other flows or optimise the
  overall use of transmission resources {{Cus22}}.

- The rate of acknowledgment packets can reduce link efficiency, including
  transmission opportunities or battery life, as well as transmission
  opportunities available to other flows sharing the same link.


However, as discussed in {{implementation}}, a unilateral reduction in
acknowledgement frequency can lead to undesirable consequences for congestion
control and loss recovery. {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} specifies a simple delayed
acknowledgment mechanism ({{Section 13.2.1 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}) without any
ability for the data sender to influence this behavior.  A data sender's constraints
on the acknowledgment frequency need to be taken into account to maximize
congestion controller and loss recovery performance. This extension provides
a mechanism for a data sender to signal its preferences and constraints.

# Negotiating Extension Use {#nego}

After a data receiver advertises support for this extension, two new frames
can be sent by the data sender to provide guidance about delaying and sending
ACK frames. These frames are the ACK_FREQUENCY frame
(see {{ack-frequency-frame}}) and the IMMEDIATE_ACK frame
(see {{immediate-ack-frame}}).

Endpoints advertise their support of the extension described in this document by
sending the following transport parameter ({{Section 7.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}):

min_ack_delay (0xff04de1b):

: A variable-length integer representing the minimum amount of time, in
  microseconds, that the endpoint sending this value is willing to
  delay an acknowledgment. This limit could be based on the data receiver's
  clock or timer granularity. min_ack_delay is used by the data sender to
  avoid requesting too small a value in the Requested Max Ack Delay field of the
  ACK_FREQUENCY frame.

An endpoint's min_ack_delay MUST NOT be greater than its max_ack_delay.
Endpoints that support this extension MUST treat receipt of a min_ack_delay that
is greater than the max_ack_delay as a connection error of type
TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR. Note that while the endpoint's max_ack_delay
transport parameter is in milliseconds ({{Section 18.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}),
min_ack_delay is specified in microseconds.

The min_ack_delay transport parameter is a unilateral indication of support for
receiving ACK_FREQUENCY frames.  If an endpoint sends the transport parameter,
the peer is allowed to send ACK_FREQUENCY and IMMEDIATE_ACK frames independent
of whether it also sends the min_ack_delay transport parameter or not.

Until an ACK_FREQUENCY or IMMEDIATE_ACK frame is received, sending the min_ack_delay transport
parameter does not cause the endpoint to change its acknowledgment behavior.

Endpoints MUST NOT remember the value of the min_ack_delay transport parameter
they received for use in a subsequent connection. Consequently, ACK_FREQUENCY
and IMMEDIATE_ACK frames cannot be sent in 0-RTT packets, as per
{{Section 7.4.1 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

This Transport Parameter is encoded as per {{Section 18 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

# ACK_FREQUENCY Frame {#ack-frequency-frame}

Delaying acknowledgments as much as possible reduces work done by the endpoints
as well as network load. A data sender's loss detection and congestion control
mechanisms however need to be tolerant of this delay at the peer. A data sender
signals the conditions under which it wants to receive ACK frames using an
ACK_FREQUENCY frame, shown below:

~~~
ACK_FREQUENCY Frame {
  Type (i) = 0xaf,
  Sequence Number (i),
  Ack-Eliciting Threshold (i),
  Requested Max Ack Delay (i),
  Reordering Threshold (i),
}
~~~

Following the common frame format described in {{Section 12.4 of
QUIC-TRANSPORT}}, ACK_FREQUENCY frames have a type of 0xaf, and contain the
following fields:

Sequence Number:

: A variable-length integer representing the sequence number assigned to the
  ACK_FREQUENCY frame by the sender so receivers ignore obsolete
  frames.  A sending endpoint MUST send monotonically increasing values in
  the Sequence Number field to allow obsolete ACK_FREQUENCY frames to be
  ignored when packets are processed out of order.

Ack-Eliciting Threshold:

: A variable-length integer representing the maximum number of ack-eliciting
  packets the recipient of this frame receives before sending an acknowledgment.
  A receiving endpoint SHOULD send at least one ACK frame after receiving more
  than this many ack-eliciting packets. A value of 0 results in
  a receiver immediately acknowledging every ack-eliciting packet. By default, an
  endpoint sends an ACK frame for every other ack-eliciting packet, as specified in
  {{Section 13.2.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}, which corresponds to a value of 1.

Requested Max Ack Delay:

: A variable-length integer representing the value to which the data sender
  requests the data receiver update its max_ack_delay
  ({{Section 18.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}). The value of this field is in
  microseconds, unlike the max_ack_delay transport parameter, which is in
  milliseconds. On receipt of a valid value, the endpoint SHOULD update
  its max_ack_delay to the value provided by the peer. Note that values
  of 2^14 or greater are invalid for max_ack_delay, as specified in
  {{Section 18.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. A value smaller than the min_ack_delay
  advertised by the peer is also invalid. Receipt of an invalid value MUST be
  treated as a connection error of type FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.

Reordering Threshold:

: A variable-length integer that indicates the maximum packet
  reordering before eliciting an immediate ACK, as specified in {{out-of-order}}.
  If no ACK_FREQUENCY frames have been received, the data receiver immediately
  acknowledges any subsequent packets that are received out-of-order, as specified
  in {{Section 13.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}, corresponding to a default value of 1.
  A value of 0 indicates out-of-order packets do not elicit an immediate ACK.

ACK_FREQUENCY frames are ack-eliciting and congestion controlled. When an
ACK_FREQUENCY frame is lost, the sender is encouraged to send another
ACK_FREQUENCY frame, unless an ACK_FREQUENCY frame with a larger Sequence Number
value has already been sent. However, it is not forbidden to retransmit the lost
frame (see {{Section 13.3 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}), because the receiver will ignore
duplicate or out-of-order ACK_FREQUENCY frames based on the Sequence Number.

A receiving endpoint MUST ignore a received ACK_FREQUENCY frame unless the
Sequence Number value in the frame is greater than the largest processed
value.

# IMMEDIATE_ACK Frame {#immediate-ack-frame}

A sender can use an ACK_FREQUENCY frame to reduce the number of acknowledgments
sent by a receiver, but doing so increases the likelihood that time-sensitive
feedback is delayed as well. For example, as described in {{loss}}, delaying
acknowledgments can increase the time it takes for a sender to detect packet
loss. Sending an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame can help mitigate this problem.

An IMMEDIATE_ACK frame can be useful in other situations as well. For example,
if a sender wants an immediate RTT measurement or if a sender wants to establish
receiver liveness as quickly as possible. PING frames
({{Section 19.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}) are ack-eliciting, but if a PING frame is
sent without an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame, the receiver might not immediately send
an ACK based on its local ACK strategy.

By definition IMMEDIATE_ACK frames are ack-eliciting and they are also
congestion controlled. An endpoint SHOULD send a packet containing an ACK frame
immediately upon receiving an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame. An endpoint MAY delay sending
an ACK frame despite receiving an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame. For example, an endpoint
might do this if a large number of received packets contain an IMMEDIATE_ACK or
if the endpoint is under heavy load.

~~~
IMMEDIATE_ACK Frame {
  Type (i) = 0x1f,
}
~~~

# Sending Acknowledgments {#sending}

Prior to receiving an ACK_FREQUENCY frame, endpoints send acknowledgments as
specified in {{Section 13.2.1 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

On receiving an ACK_FREQUENCY frame and updating its max_ack_delay
and Ack-Eliciting Threshold values ({{ack-frequency-frame}}), the data receiver
sends an acknowledgment when one of the following conditions are met since the
last acknowledgement was sent:

- The number of received ack-eliciting packets is greater than the
  Ack-Eliciting Threshold.

- max_ack_delay amount of time has passed.

An acknowledgment can be sent earlier based on the value of the
Reordering Threshold when a gap in packet numbers is detected,
see {{out-of-order}}.

{{congestion}} and {{batch}} describe exceptions to this strategy.

## Response to long idle periods

It is important to receive timely feedback after long idle periods,
e.g. update stale RTT measurements. When no acknowledgment has been sent in
over one smoothed round trip time ({{Section 5.3 of QUIC-RECOVERY}}),
receivers are encouraged to send an acknowledgment soon after receiving
an ack-eliciting packet. This is not an issue specific to this document,
but the mechanisms specified herein could create excessive delays.

## Response to Out-of-Order Packets {#out-of-order}

As specified in {{Section 13.2.1 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}, endpoints are expected to
send an immediate acknowledgment upon receipt of a reordered ack-eliciting
packet. After an ACK_FREQUENCY frame with a Reordering Threshold value other
than 1 has been received, this extension delays immediate acknowledgements
to reordered ack-eliciting packets and the gaps they can create.

If the most recent ACK_FREQUENCY frame received from the peer has a Reordering
Threshold value of 0, the endpoint SHOULD NOT send an immediate
acknowledgment in response to packets received out of order, and instead
rely on the peer's Ack-Eliciting Threshold and Requested Max Ack Delay
for sending acknowledgments.

If the most recent ACK_FREQUENCY frame received from the peer has a Reordering
Threshold value larger than 1, the endpoint tests the amount of reordering
before deciding to send an acknowledgment. The specification uses the following
definitions:

Largest Unacked:
: The largest packet number among all received ack-eliciting packets.

Largest Acked:
: The Largest Acknowledged value sent in an ACK frame.

Largest Reported:
: The largest packet number that could be declared lost with the specified
  Reordering Threshold, which is Largest Acked - Reordering Threshold + 1.

Unreported Missing:
: Packets with packet numbers between the Largest Unacked and Largest Reported
  that have not yet been received.

An endpoint that receives an ACK_FREQUENCY frame with a non-zero Reordering
Threshold value SHOULD send an immediate ACK when the gap
between the smallest Unreported Missing packet and the Largest Unacked is greater
than or equal to the Reordering Threshold value. Sending this additional ACK will
reset the max_ack_delay timer and Ack-Eliciting Threshold counter (as any ACK
would do).

See {{examples}} for examples explaining this behavior. See {{set-threshold}}
for guidance on how to choose the reordering threshold value when sending
ACK_FREQUENCY frames.

### Examples {#examples}

When the reordering threshold is 1, any time a packet is received
and there is a missing packet, an immediate acknowledgement is sent.

If the reordering theshold is 3 and acknowledgements are only sent due to
reordering, the sequence in {{ack-reordering-3}} would occur:

| Received Packet| Largest Unacked| Largest Acked| Largest Reported| Unreported Missing| Send Acknowledgement |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | --- | --- |
|  1 |  1 |  - |  - |   - |  No |
|  3 |  3 |  - |  - |   2 |  No |
|  4 |  4 |  - |  - |   2 |  No |
|  5 |  5 |  - |  - |   2 | Yes (5 - 2 >= 3) |
|  8 |  8 |  5 |  3 | 6,7 |  No |
|  9 |  9 |  5 |  3 | 6,7 | Yes (9 - 6 >= 3) |
| 10 | 10 |  9 |  7 |   7 | Yes (10 - 7 >= 3) |
{: #ack-reordering-3 title="Acknowledgement behavior with a reordering threshold of 3"}

Note that in this example, the receipt of packet 9 triggers an ACK
that reports both packets 6 and 7 as missing. However,
the receipt of packet 10 needs to trigger another immediate ACK
because the sender will be unable to declare packet 7 as lost
(with a reordering threshold of 3) until it receives an ACK
reporting the reception of packet 10.

If the reordering threshold is 5 and acknowledgements are only sent due to
reordering, the sequence in {{ack-reordering-5}} would occur:

| Received Packet| Largest Unacked| Largest Acked| Largest Reported| Unreported Missing| Send Acknowledgement |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | --- | --- |
|  1 |  1 |  - |  - |   - |  No |
|  3 |  3 |  - |  - |   2 |  No |
|  5 |  5 |  - |  - | 2,4 |  No |
|  6 |  6 |  - |  - | 2,4 |  No |
|  7 |  7 |  - |  - | 2,4 | Yes  (7 - 2 >= 5)|
|  8 |  8 |  7 |  3 |   4 |  No |
|  9 |  9 |  7 |  3 |   4 | Yes  (9 - 4 >= 5)|
{: #ack-reordering-5 title="Acknowledgement behavior with a reordering threshold of 5"}

## Setting the Reordering Threshold value {#set-threshold}

To ensure timely loss detection, a data sender can send a Reordering Threshold
value of 1 less than the loss detection packet threshold. If the threshold is
smaller than the packet threshold, an acknowledgement is unnecessarily sent
before the packet can be declared lost. If the value is larger, it can cause
unnecessary delays in loss detection. ({{Section 6.1.1 of QUIC-RECOVERY}})
recommends a default packet threshold for loss detection of 3, equivalent to
a Reordering Threshold of 2.

## Expediting Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Signals {#congestion}

If the Ack-Eliciting Threshold is larger than 1, an endpoint SHOULD send
an immediate acknowledgement when a packet marked with the ECN Congestion
Experienced (CE) {{?RFC3168}} codepoint in the IP header is received and
the previously received packet was not marked CE. From there on, if multiple
consecutive CE-marked packets are received or only non-CE-marked packet received,
the endpoint resumes sending acknowledgements based on the Ack-Eliciting
Threshold or max_ack_delay. Therefore, CE-marking only triggers an immediate
acknowledgement when there is a transition from non-CE-marked to CE-marked.

Doing this maintains the peer's response time to congestion events, while also
reducing the ACK rate compared to {{Section 13.2.1 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}} during
extreme congestion or when peers are using DCTCP {{?RFC8257}} or other
congestion controllers (e.g. {{?I-D.ietf-tsvwg-aqm-dualq-coupled}}) that mark
more frequently than classic ECN {{?RFC3168}}.

## Batch Processing of Packets {#batch}

To avoid sending multiple acknowledgments in rapid succession, an endpoint can
process all packets in a batch before determining whether to send an ACK frame
in response, as stated in {{Section 13.2.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

# Computation of Probe Timeout Period

After requesting an update to the data receivers's max_ack_delay, a data sender
can use this new value in later computations of its Probe Timeout (PTO) period;
see {{Section 5.2.1 of QUIC-RECOVERY}}.

Until the packet carrying the ACK_FREQUENCY frame is acknowledged, the endpoint
MUST use the greater of the current max_ack_delay and the value that is in flight
when computing the PTO period. Doing so avoids spurious PTOs that can be caused by
an update that decreases the peer's max_ack_delay.

While it is expected that endpoints will have only one ACK_FREQUENCY frame in
flight at any given time, this extension does not prohibit having more than one
in flight. When using max_ack_delay for PTO computations, endpoints MUST use
the maximum of the current value and all those in flight.

When the number of in-flight ack-eliciting packets is larger than the
ACK-Eliciting Threshold, an endpoint can expect that the peer will not need to
wait for its max_ack_delay period before sending an acknowledgment. In such
cases, the endpoint MAY exclude the peer's max_ack_delay from its PTO
calculation.  When Reordering Threshold is set to 0 and loss prevents the peer
from receiving enough packets to trigger an immediate acknowledgment, the receiver
will wait max_ack_delay, increasing the chances of a premature PTO.
Therefore, if Reordering Threshold is set to 0, the PTO MUST be larger than the
peer's max_ack_delay.

When sending PTO packets, one can include an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame to elicit an
immediate acknowledgment. This avoids delaying acknowledgements of PTO packets
by the ack delay, reducing tail latency and allowing the sender
to exclude the peer's max_ack_delay from subsequent PTO calculations.

# Determining Acknowledgment Frequency {#implementation}

This section provides some guidance on a sender's choice of acknowledgment
frequency and discusses some additional considerations. Implementers can select
an appropriate strategy to meet the needs of their applications and congestion
controllers.

## Congestion Control

A sender needs to be responsive to notifications of congestion, such as
a packet loss or an ECN CE marking. Decreasing the acknowledgment frequency
can delay a sender's response to network congestion or cause it to underutilize
the available bandwidth.

To limit the consequences of reduced acknowledgment frequency, a sender
can use the extension in this draft to request a receiver
to send an acknowledgment at least once per round trip,
when there are ack-eliciting packets in flight, in the following ways:

A data sender can set the Requested Max Ack Delay value
to no more than the estimated round trip time.
The sender can also improve feedback and robustness to
variation in the path RTT by setting the Ack-Eliciting Threshold
to a value no larger than number of maximum-sized packets that fit
into the current congestion window.
Alternatively, a sender can send an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame if no acknowledgement
has been received for more than one round trip time.  If the
packet containing an IMMEDIATE_ACK is lost, detection of that loss
will be delayed by the Reordering Threshold or Requested Max Ack Delay.

When setting the Requested Max Ack Delay as a function of the RTT, it is usually
better to use the Smoothed RTT (smoothed_rtt) ({{Section 5.3 of QUIC-RECOVERY}}) or another
estimate of the typical RTT, but not the minimum RTT (min_rtt)
({{Section 5.2 of QUIC-RECOVERY}}). This avoids eliciting an
unnecessarily high number of acknowledgments when min_rtt is much smaller than
smoothed_rtt.

Note that the congestion window and the RTT estimate change over the lifetime of a
connection and therefore might require sending updates in an ACK_FREQUENCY frames to
ensure optimal performance, though not every change should trigger an update.
Usually, it is not necessary to send an ACK_FREQUENCY frame more than once per
RTT and likely even less frequently. Ideally, an ACK_FREQUENCY frame is sent only
when a relevant change in the congestion window or smoothed RTT is detected that
impacts the local setting of the reordering threshold or locally-selected calculation
of the either Ack-Eliciting Threshold or the Requested Max Ack Delay.

It is possible that the RTT is smaller than the receiver's timer granularity,
as communicated via the min_ack_delay transport parameter, preventing the
receiver from sending an acknowledgment every RTT in time unless packets are
acknowledged immediately.  In these cases, Reordering Threshold values other than 1
can delay loss detection more than an RTT.

### Application-Limited Connections

A congestion controller that is limited by the congestion window relies upon receiving
acknowledgments to send additional data into the network.  An increase in
acknowledgment delay increases the delay in sending data, which can reduce the
achieved throughput.  Congestion window growth can also depend upon receiving
acknowledgments. This can be particularly significant in slow start
({{Section 7.3.1 of QUIC-RECOVERY}}), when delaying acknowledgments can delay
the increase in congestion window and can create larger packet bursts.

If the sender is application-limited, acknowledgments can be delayed
unnecessarily when entering idle periods. Therefore, if no further data is
buffered to be sent, a sender can send an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame with the last data
packet before an idle period to avoid waiting for the ack delay.

If there are no inflight packets, no acknowledgments will be received for at least
a round trip when sending resumes. The max_ack_delay and Ack-Eliciting Threshold
values used by the receiver can further delay acknowledgments.  In this case, the
sender can include an IMMEDIATE_ACK or ACK_FREQUENCY frame in the first
Ack-Eliciting packet to avoid waiting for substantially more than a round trip
for an acknowledgment.

## Burst Mitigation

Receiving an acknowledgment can allow a sender to release new packets into the
network. If a sender is designed to rely on the timing of peer acknowledgments
("ACK clock"), delaying acknowledgments can cause undesirable bursts of data
into the network. In keeping with {{Section 7.7 of QUIC-RECOVERY}}, a sender
can either employ pacing or limit bursts to the initial congestion window.

## Loss Detection and Timers {#loss}

Acknowledgments are fundamental to reliability in QUIC. Consequently,
delaying or reducing the frequency of acknowledgments can cause loss detection
at the sender to be delayed.

A QUIC sender detects loss using packet thresholds on receiving an
acknowledgment ({{Section 6.1.1 of QUIC-RECOVERY}}); delaying the
acknowledgment therefore delays this method of detecting losses.

Reducing acknowledgment frequency reduces the number of RTT samples that a
sender receives ({{Section 5 of QUIC-RECOVERY}}), making a sender's RTT estimate
less responsive to changes in the path's RTT. As a result, any mechanisms that
rely on an accurate RTT estimate, such as time-threshold-based loss detection ({{Section
6.1.2 of QUIC-RECOVERY}}) or the Probe Timeout (PTO) ({{Section 6.2 of QUIC-RECOVERY}}),
will be less responsive to changes in the path's RTT, resulting in either
delayed or unnecessary packet transmissions.

A sender might use timers to detect loss of PMTU probe packets
({{Section 14 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}). A sender MAY
bundle an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame with any PMTU probes to avoid triggering such
timers.

## Connection Migration {#migration}

To avoid additional delays to connection migration confirmation when using this
extension, a client can bundle an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame with the first non-probing
frame ({{Section 9.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}) it sends or it can send only an
IMMEDIATE_ACK frame, which is a non-probing frame.

An endpoint's congestion controller and RTT estimator are reset upon
confirmation of migration ({{Section 9.4 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}});
this changes the pattern of acknowledgments received after migration.

Therefore, an endpoint that has sent an ACK_FREQUENCY frame earlier in the
connection ought to send a new ACK_FREQUENCY frame upon confirmation of
connection migration with updated information, e.g. to consider the new RTT estimate.

# Security Considerations

An improperly configured or malicious data sender could request a
data receiver to acknowledge more frequently than its available resources
permit. However, there are two limits that make such an attack largely
inconsequential. First, the acknowledgment rate is bounded by the rate at which
data is received. Second, ACK_FREQUENCY and IMMEDIATE_ACK frames can only request
an increase in the acknowledgment rate, but cannot enforce it.

{{Section 21.9 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}} provides further guidance on peer denial of service
attacks that could abuse control frames, including ACK frames as well as the newly herein specified
ACK_FREQUENCY and IMMEDIATE_ACK frames, to cause disproportional
processing costs without observable impact on the state of the connection.
Especially, the IMMEDIATE_ACK frame does not only imply processing cost for receiving
and processing the control frame itself but can also cause additional sending of
packets. However, in general, with this extension, a sender cannot force a receiver to acknowledge
more frequently than the receiver considers safe based on its resource constraints.
