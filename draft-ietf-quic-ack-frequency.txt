1.  Introduction

   The QUIC transport protocol recommends sending an ACK frame after
   receiving at least two ack-eliciting packets; see Section 13.2 of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  However, the data receiver determines how
   frequently to send acknowledgments in response to ack-eliciting
   packets, without any ability for the data sender to influence this
   behavior.  This document specifies an extension to QUIC that enables
   an endpoint to request its peer change its behavior when sending or
   delaying acknowledgments.

   This document defines a new transport parameter that indicates
   support of this extension and specifies two new frame types to
   request changes to the peer's acknowledgement behavior.

1.1.  Terms and Definitions

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   In the rest of this document, "sender" refers to a QUIC data sender
   (and acknowledgment receiver).  Similarly, "receiver" refers to a
   QUIC data receiver (and acknowledgment sender).

   This document uses terms, definitions, and notational conventions
   described in Section 1.2 and Section 1.3 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

2.  Motivation

   A receiver acknowledges received packets, but can delay sending these
   acknowledgments.  Delaying acknowledgments can impact a data sender's
   throughput, loss detection and congestion controller performance, as
   well as CPU utilization at both endpoints.

   Reducing the frequency of acknowledgments can improve connection and
   endpoint performance in the following ways:

   *  Sending UDP datagrams is very CPU intensive on some platforms.  A
      data receiver can decrease its CPU usage by reducing the number of
      acknowledgement-only packets sent.  Experience shows that this
      reduction can be critical for high packet rate connections.

   *  Similarly, receiving UDP datagrams can also be CPU intensive.
      Reducing the acknowledgement frequency also reduces the data
      sender's CPU usage because it receives and processes fewer
      acknowledgment-only packets.

   *  For asymmetric link technologies, such as DOCSIS, LTE, and
      satellite, connection throughput in the forward path can become
      constrained when the reverse path is filled by acknowledgment
      packets [RFC3449].  When traversing such links, reducing the
      number of acknowledgments can achieve higher connection
      throughput, lower the impact on other flows or optimise the
      overall use of transmission resources [Cus22].

   *  The rate of acknowledgment packets can reduce link efficiency,
      including transmission opportunities or battery life, as well as
      transmission opportunities available to other flows sharing the
      same link.

   However, as discussed in Section 8, a unilateral reduction in
   acknowledgement frequency can lead to undesirable consequences for
   congestion control and loss recovery.  [QUIC-TRANSPORT] specifies a
   simple delayed acknowledgment mechanism (Section 13.2.1 of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) without any ability for the data sender to
   influence this behavior.  A data sender's constraints on the
   acknowledgment frequency need to be taken into account to maximize
   congestion controller and loss recovery performance.  This extension
   provides a mechanism for a data sender to signal its preferences and
   constraints.

3.  Negotiating Extension Use

   After a data receiver advertises support for this extension, two new
   frames can be sent by the data sender to provide guidance about
   delaying and sending ACK frames.  These frames are the ACK_FREQUENCY
   frame (see Section 4) and the IMMEDIATE_ACK frame (see Section 5).

   Endpoints advertise their support for receiving ACK_FREQUENCY and
   IMMEDIATE_ACK frames as described in this document by sending the
   following transport parameter (Section 7.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]):

   min_ack_delay (0xff04de1b):  A variable-length integer representing
      the minimum amount of time, in microseconds, that the endpoint
      sending this value is willing to delay an acknowledgment.  This
      limit could be based on the data receiver's clock or timer
      granularity. min_ack_delay is used by the data sender to avoid
      requesting too small a value in the Requested Max Ack Delay field
      of the ACK_FREQUENCY frame.

   An endpoint's min_ack_delay MUST NOT be greater than its
   max_ack_delay.  Endpoints that support this extension MUST treat
   receipt of a min_ack_delay that is greater than the max_ack_delay as
   a connection error of type TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.  Note that
   while the endpoint's max_ack_delay transport parameter is in
   milliseconds (Section 18.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]), min_ack_delay is
   specified in microseconds.

   The min_ack_delay transport parameter is a unilateral indication of
   support for receiving ACK_FREQUENCY frames.  If an endpoint sends the
   transport parameter, the peer is allowed to send ACK_FREQUENCY and
   IMMEDIATE_ACK frames independent of whether it also sends the
   min_ack_delay transport parameter or not.

   Until an ACK_FREQUENCY or IMMEDIATE_ACK frame is received, sending
   the min_ack_delay transport parameter does not cause the endpoint to
   change its acknowledgment behavior.

   Endpoints MUST NOT remember the value of the min_ack_delay transport
   parameter they received for use in a subsequent connection.
   Consequently, ACK_FREQUENCY and IMMEDIATE_ACK frames cannot be sent
   in 0-RTT packets, as per Section 7.4.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   This Transport Parameter is encoded as per Section 18 of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

4.  ACK_FREQUENCY Frame

   Delaying acknowledgments as much as possible reduces work done by the
   endpoints as well as network load.  A data sender's loss detection
   and congestion control mechanisms however need to be tolerant of this
   delay at the peer.  A data sender signals the conditions under which
   it wants to receive ACK frames using an ACK_FREQUENCY frame, shown
   below:

   ACK_FREQUENCY Frame {
     Type (i) = 0xaf,
     Sequence Number (i),
     Ack-Eliciting Threshold (i),
     Requested Max Ack Delay (i),
     Reordering Threshold (i),
   }

   Following the common frame format described in Section 12.4 of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT], ACK_FREQUENCY frames have a type of 0xaf, and
   contain the following fields:

   Sequence Number:  A variable-length integer representing the sequence
      number assigned to the ACK_FREQUENCY frame by the sender so
      receivers ignore obsolete frames.  A sending endpoint MUST send
      monotonically increasing values in the Sequence Number field to
      allow obsolete ACK_FREQUENCY frames to be ignored when packets are
      processed out of order.

   Ack-Eliciting Threshold:  A variable-length integer representing the
      maximum number of ack-eliciting packets the recipient of this
      frame receives without sending an acknowledgment.  A receiving
      endpoint SHOULD send at least one ACK frame after receiving more
      than this many ack-eliciting packets.  A value of 0 results in a
      receiver immediately acknowledging every ack-eliciting packet.  By
      default, an endpoint sends an ACK frame for every other ack-
      eliciting packet, as specified in Section 13.2.2 of
      [QUIC-TRANSPORT], which corresponds to a value of 1.

   Requested Max Ack Delay:  A variable-length integer representing the
      value to which the data sender requests the data receiver update
      its max_ack_delay (Section 18.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).  The value
      of this field is in microseconds, unlike the max_ack_delay
      transport parameter, which is in milliseconds.  On receipt of a
      valid value, the endpoint SHOULD update its max_ack_delay to the
      value provided by the peer.  Note that values of 2^14 milliseconds
      or greater are invalid for max_ack_delay, as specified in
      Section 18.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  A value smaller than the
      min_ack_delay advertised by the peer is also invalid.  Receipt of
      an invalid value MUST be treated as a connection error of type
      PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

   Reordering Threshold:  A variable-length integer that indicates the
      maximum packet reordering before eliciting an immediate ACK, as
      specified in Section 6.2.  If no ACK_FREQUENCY frames have been
      received, the data receiver immediately acknowledges any
      subsequent packets that are received out-of-order, as specified in
      Section 13.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT], corresponding to a default value
      of 1.  A value of 0 indicates out-of-order packets do not elicit
      an immediate ACK.

   ACK_FREQUENCY frames are ack-eliciting and congestion controlled.
   When an ACK_FREQUENCY frame is lost, the sender is encouraged to send
   another ACK_FREQUENCY frame, unless an ACK_FREQUENCY frame with a
   larger Sequence Number value has already been sent.  However, it is
   not forbidden to retransmit the lost frame (see Section 13.3 of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT]), because the receiver will ignore duplicate or out-
   of-order ACK_FREQUENCY frames based on the Sequence Number.

   A receiving endpoint MUST ignore a received ACK_FREQUENCY frame
   unless the Sequence Number value in the frame is greater than the
   largest processed value.

5.  IMMEDIATE_ACK Frame

   A sender can use an ACK_FREQUENCY frame to reduce the number of
   acknowledgments sent by a receiver, but doing so increases the
   likelihood that time-sensitive feedback is delayed as well.  For
   example, as described in Section 8.3, delaying acknowledgments can
   increase the time it takes for a sender to detect packet loss.
   Sending an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame can help mitigate this problem.

   An IMMEDIATE_ACK frame can be useful in other situations as well.
   For example, if a sender wants an immediate RTT measurement or if a
   sender wants to establish receiver liveness as quickly as possible.
   PING frames (Section 19.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) are ack-eliciting, but
   if a PING frame is sent without an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame, the receiver
   might not immediately send an ACK based on its local ACK strategy.

   By definition IMMEDIATE_ACK frames are ack-eliciting and they are
   also congestion controlled.  An endpoint SHOULD send a packet
   containing an ACK frame immediately upon receiving an IMMEDIATE_ACK
   frame.  An endpoint MAY delay sending an ACK frame despite receiving
   an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame.  For example, an endpoint might do this if a
   large number of received packets contain an IMMEDIATE_ACK or if the
   endpoint is under heavy load.

   IMMEDIATE_ACK Frame {
     Type (i) = 0x1f,
   }

   IMMEDIATE_ACK frames do not need to be retransmitted.

6.  Sending Acknowledgments

   Prior to receiving an ACK_FREQUENCY frame, endpoints send
   acknowledgments as specified in Section 13.2.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   After receiving an ACK_FREQUENCY frame and updating its max_ack_delay
   and Ack-Eliciting Threshold values (Section 4), the data receiver
   sends an acknowledgment when one of the following conditions are met
   since the last acknowledgement was sent:

   *  The number of received ack-eliciting packets is greater than the
      Ack-Eliciting Threshold.

   *  max_ack_delay amount of time has passed and at least one ack-
      eliciting packet has been received.

   An acknowledgment can be sent earlier based on the value of the
   Reordering Threshold when a gap in packet numbers is detected, see
   Section 6.2.

   Section 6.3 and Section 6.4 describe exceptions to this strategy.

   All packets still have to be acknowledged at least once with this
   extension, as stated in Section 13.2.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  With
   large values for Ack-Eliciting Threshold or the Reordering Threshold,
   implementations might accumulate multiple new ACK ranges before
   sending an ACK.  As such, implementations have to take more care to
   avoid truncating ACK ranges before they are sent at least once.  As
   discussed in Section 13.2.4 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] this does not
   guarantee that every acknowledgment is seen by the sender.
   Therefore, when ACK frames are sent less often, the effect of lost or
   re-ordered packets with ACK frames needs to be considered more
   carefully when trimming the ACK range.

6.1.  Response to long idle periods

   It is important to receive timely feedback after long idle periods,
   e.g. update stale RTT measurements.  When no acknowledgment has been
   sent in over one smoothed round trip time (Section 5.3 of
   [QUIC-RECOVERY]), receivers are encouraged to send an acknowledgment
   soon after receiving an ack-eliciting packet.  This is not an issue
   specific to this document, but the mechanisms specified herein could
   create excessive delays.

6.2.  Response to Out-of-Order Packets

   As specified in Section 13.2.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT], endpoints are
   expected to send an immediate acknowledgment upon receipt of a
   reordered ack-eliciting packet.  After an ACK_FREQUENCY frame with a
   Reordering Threshold value other than 1 has been received, this
   extension delays immediate acknowledgements to reordered ack-
   eliciting packets and the gaps they can create.

   If the most recent ACK_FREQUENCY frame received from the peer has a
   Reordering Threshold value of 0, the endpoint SHOULD NOT send an
   immediate acknowledgment in response to packets received out of
   order, and instead rely on the peer's Ack-Eliciting Threshold and
   Requested Max Ack Delay for sending acknowledgments.

   If the most recent ACK_FREQUENCY frame received from the peer has a
   Reordering Threshold value larger than 1, the endpoint tests the
   amount of reordering before deciding to send an acknowledgment.  The
   specification uses the following definitions:

   Largest Unacked:  The largest packet number among all received ack-
      eliciting packets.

   Largest Acked:  The Largest Acknowledged value sent in an ACK frame.

   Largest Reported Missing:  The largest packet number that could be
      declared lost with the specified Reordering Threshold, which is
      Largest Acked - Reordering Threshold.

   Unreported Missing:  Packets with packet numbers between the Largest
      Unacked and Largest Reported Missing that have not yet been
      received.

   An endpoint that receives an ACK_FREQUENCY frame with a non-zero
   Reordering Threshold value SHOULD send an immediate ACK whenever it
   receives an ack-eliciting, out-of order packet whose packet number is
   outside the reordering window of the peer, i.e. when * the difference
   between the smallest Unreported Missing packet and the Largest
   Unacked packet is greater than or equal to the Reordering Threshold
   value; or * the received packet number is less than or equal to
   Largest Acked - Reordering Threshold.

   The first condition triggers an ACK as soon as the reordering
   threshold is reached and a packet can be declared lost at the sender.
   The second condition addresses packets that have been received later,
   out of order and are already spuriously declared lost by the sender.
   This enables the sender to detect spurious retransmissions and revert
   the congestion control status accordingly.

   Sending such an additional ACK resets the max_ack_delay timer and the
   Ack-Eliciting Threshold counter, as any ACK would.

   See Section 6.2.1 for examples explaining this behavior.  See
   Section 9 for guidance on how to choose the reordering threshold
   value when sending ACK_FREQUENCY frames.

6.2.1.  Examples

   Note that the following examples assume that packets are processed
   one-by-one in the received order as indicated below.

   When the reordering threshold is 1, any time a packet is received and
   there is a missing packet, an immediate acknowledgement is sent.

   If the reordering theshold is 3 and acknowledgements are only sent
   due to reordering, the sequence in Table 1 would occur:

   +========+=======+=======+==========+============+=================+
   |Received|Largest|Largest| Largest  | Unreported | Send            |
   |Packet  |Unacked|Acked  | Reported | Missing    | Acknowledgement |

   +--------+-------+-------+----------+------------+-----------------+

    Table 1: Acknowledgement behavior with a reordering threshold of 3

   Note that in this example, the receipt of packet 9 triggers an ACK
   that reports both packets 6 and 7 as missing.  However, the receipt
   of packet 10 needs to trigger another immediate ACK because the
   sender will be unable to declare packet 7 as lost (with a reordering
   threshold of 3) until it receives an ACK reporting the reception of
   packet 10.

   If the reordering threshold is 5 and acknowledgements are only sent
   due to reordering, the sequence in Table 2 would occur:

6.3.  Expediting Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Signals

   If the Ack-Eliciting Threshold is larger than 1, an endpoint SHOULD
   send an immediate acknowledgement when a packet marked with the ECN
   Congestion Experienced (CE) [RFC3168] codepoint in the IP header is
   received and the previously received packet was not marked CE.  From
   there on, if multiple consecutive CE-marked packets are received or
   only non-CE-marked packet received, the endpoint resumes sending
   acknowledgements based on the Ack-Eliciting Threshold or
   max_ack_delay.  Therefore, CE-marking only triggers an immediate
   acknowledgement when there is a transition from non-CE-marked to CE-
   marked.

   If the Ack-Eliciting Threshold is 0, every ack-eliciting packet is
   immediately acknowledged, whether it is CE marked or not.  If the
   Ack-Eliciting Threshold is 1, the default behavior as specified in
   RFC9000 applies, which recommends to immediately acknowledge all
   packets marked with CE (see Section 13.2.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).

   Acknowledging the first CE marked packet immediately maintains the
   peer's response time to congestion events, while also reducing the
   ACK rate compared to Section 13.2.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] during
   extreme congestion or when peers are using DCTCP [RFC8257] or other
   congestion controllers (e.g. [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-aqm-dualq-coupled]) that
   mark more frequently than classic ECN [RFC3168].

6.4.  Batch Processing of Packets

   To avoid sending multiple acknowledgments in rapid succession, an
   endpoint can process all packets in a batch before determining
   whether to send an ACK frame in response, as stated in Section 13.2.2
   of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

7.  Computation of Probe Timeout Period

   After requesting an update to the data receivers's max_ack_delay, a
   data sender can use this new value in later computations of its Probe
   Timeout (PTO) period; see Section 5.2.1 of [QUIC-RECOVERY].

   Until the packet carrying the ACK_FREQUENCY frame is acknowledged,
   the endpoint MUST use the greater of the current max_ack_delay and
   the value that is in flight when computing the PTO period.  Doing so
   avoids spurious PTOs that can be caused by an update that decreases
   the peer's max_ack_delay.

   While it is expected that endpoints will have only one ACK_FREQUENCY
   frame in flight at any given time, this extension does not prohibit
   having more than one in flight.  When using max_ack_delay for PTO
   computations, endpoints MUST use the maximum of the current value and
   all those in flight.

   When the number of in-flight ack-eliciting packets is larger than the
   ACK-Eliciting Threshold, an endpoint can expect that the peer will
   not need to wait for its max_ack_delay period before sending an
   acknowledgment.  In such cases, the endpoint MAY exclude the peer's
   max_ack_delay from its PTO calculation.  When Reordering Threshold is
   set to 0 and loss prevents the peer from receiving enough packets to
   trigger an immediate acknowledgment, the receiver will wait
   max_ack_delay, increasing the chances of a premature PTO.  Therefore,
   if Reordering Threshold is set to 0, the PTO MUST be larger than the
   peer's max_ack_delay.

   When sending PTO packets, one can include an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame to
   elicit an immediate acknowledgment.  This avoids delaying
   acknowledgements of PTO packets by the acknowledgment delay, reducing
   tail latency and allowing the sender to exclude the peer's
   max_ack_delay from subsequent PTO calculations.

8.  Determining Acknowledgment Frequency

   This section provides some guidance on a sender's choice of
   acknowledgment frequency and discusses some additional
   considerations.  Implementers can select an appropriate strategy to
   meet the needs of their applications and congestion controllers.

8.1.  Congestion Control

   A sender needs to be responsive to notifications of congestion, such
   as a packet loss or an ECN CE marking.  Decreasing the acknowledgment
   frequency can delay a sender's response to network congestion or
   cause it to underutilize the available bandwidth.

   To limit the consequences of reduced acknowledgment frequency, a
   sender can use the extension in this draft to request a receiver to
   send an acknowledgment at least once per round trip, when there are
   ack-eliciting packets in flight, in the following ways:

   A data sender can set the Requested Max Ack Delay value to no more
   than the estimated round trip time.  The sender can also improve
   feedback and robustness to variation in the path RTT by setting the
   Ack-Eliciting Threshold to a value no larger than number of maximum-
   sized packets that fit into the current congestion window.
   Alternatively, a sender can send an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame if no
   acknowledgement has been received for more than one round trip time.
   If the packet containing an IMMEDIATE_ACK is lost, detection of that
   loss will be delayed by the Reordering Threshold or Requested Max Ack
   Delay.

   When setting the Requested Max Ack Delay as a function of the RTT, it
   is usually better to use the Smoothed RTT (smoothed_rtt) (Section 5.3
   of [QUIC-RECOVERY]) or another estimate of the typical RTT, but not
   the minimum RTT (min_rtt) (Section 5.2 of [QUIC-RECOVERY]).  This
   avoids eliciting an unnecessarily high number of acknowledgments when
   min_rtt is much smaller than smoothed_rtt.

   Note that the congestion window and the RTT estimate change over the
   lifetime of a connection and therefore might require sending updates
   in an ACK_FREQUENCY frames to ensure optimal performance, though not
   every change should trigger an update.  Usually, it is not necessary
   to send an ACK_FREQUENCY frame more than once per RTT and likely even
   less frequently.  Ideally, an ACK_FREQUENCY frame is sent only when a
   relevant change in the congestion window or smoothed RTT is detected
   that impacts the local setting of the reordering threshold or
   locally-selected calculation of the either Ack-Eliciting Threshold or
   the Requested Max Ack Delay.

   It is possible that the RTT is smaller than the receiver's timer
   granularity, as communicated via the min_ack_delay transport
   parameter, preventing the receiver from sending an acknowledgment
   every RTT in time unless packets are acknowledged immediately.  In
   these cases, Reordering Threshold values other than 1 can delay loss
   detection more than an RTT.

8.1.1.  Application-Limited Connections

   A congestion controller that is limited by the congestion window
   relies upon receiving acknowledgments to send additional data into
   the network.  An increase in acknowledgment delay increases the delay
   in sending data, which can reduce the achieved throughput.
   Congestion window growth can also depend upon receiving
   acknowledgments.  This can be particularly significant in slow start
   (Section 7.3.1 of [QUIC-RECOVERY]), when delaying acknowledgments can
   delay the increase in congestion window and can create larger packet
   bursts.

   If the sender is application-limited, acknowledgments can be delayed
   unnecessarily when entering idle periods.  Therefore, if no further
   data is buffered to be sent, a sender can send an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame
   with the last data packet before an idle period to avoid waiting for
   the acknowledgment delay.

   If there are no inflight packets, no acknowledgments will be received
   for at least a round trip when sending resumes.  The max_ack_delay
   and Ack-Eliciting Threshold values used by the receiver can further
   delay acknowledgments.  In this case, the sender can include an
   IMMEDIATE_ACK or ACK_FREQUENCY frame in the first Ack-Eliciting
   packet to avoid waiting for substantially more than a round trip for
   an acknowledgment.

8.2.  Burst Mitigation

   Receiving an acknowledgment can allow a sender to release new packets
   into the network.  If a sender is designed to rely on the timing of
   peer acknowledgments ("ACK clock"), delaying acknowledgments can
   cause undesirable bursts of data into the network.  In keeping with
   Section 7.7 of [QUIC-RECOVERY], a sender can either employ pacing or
   limit bursts to the initial congestion window.

8.3.  Loss Detection and Timers

   Acknowledgments are fundamental to reliability in QUIC.
   Consequently, delaying or reducing the frequency of acknowledgments
   can cause loss detection at the sender to be delayed.

   A QUIC sender detects loss using packet thresholds on receiving an
   acknowledgment (Section 6.1.1 of [QUIC-RECOVERY]); delaying the
   acknowledgment therefore delays this method of detecting losses.

   Reducing acknowledgment frequency reduces the number of RTT samples
   that a sender receives (Section 5 of [QUIC-RECOVERY]), making a
   sender's RTT estimate less responsive to changes in the path's RTT.
   As a result, any mechanisms that rely on an accurate RTT estimate,
   such as time-threshold-based loss detection (Section 6.1.2 of
   [QUIC-RECOVERY]) or the Probe Timeout (PTO) (Section 6.2 of
   [QUIC-RECOVERY]), will be less responsive to changes in the path's
   RTT, resulting in either delayed or unnecessary packet transmissions.

   A sender might use timers to detect loss of PMTU probe packets
   (Section 14 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).  A sender MAY bundle an
   IMMEDIATE_ACK frame with any PMTU probes to avoid triggering such
   timers.

8.4.  Connection Migration

   To avoid additional delays to connection migration confirmation when
   using this extension, a client can bundle an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame with
   the first non-probing frame (Section 9.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) it
   sends or it can send only an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame, which is a non-
   probing frame.

   An endpoint's congestion controller and RTT estimator are reset upon
   confirmation of migration (Section 9.4 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]); this
   changes the pattern of acknowledgments received after migration.

   Therefore, an endpoint that has sent an ACK_FREQUENCY frame earlier
   in the connection ought to send a new ACK_FREQUENCY frame upon
   confirmation of connection migration with updated information, e.g.
   to consider the new RTT estimate.

9.  Setting the Reordering Threshold Value

   To ensure timely loss detection, a data sender can send a Reordering
   Threshold value that is the same as the loss detection packet
   threshold.  If the reordering threshold is smaller than the packet
   threshold, an acknowledgement is unnecessarily sent before the packet
   can be declared lost.  If the value is larger, it can cause
   unnecessary delays in loss detection (Section 6.1.1 of
   [QUIC-RECOVERY]).

   In order to avoid unnecessary immediate acknowledgements, senders
   SHOULD implement adaptive packet threshold loss detection and
   communicate the increased Reordering Threshold value to the receiver.

10.  Security Considerations

   An improperly configured or malicious data sender could request a
   data receiver to acknowledge more frequently than its available
   resources permit.  However, there are two limits that make such an
   attack largely inconsequential.  First, the acknowledgment rate is
   bounded by the rate at which data is received.  Second, ACK_FREQUENCY
   and IMMEDIATE_ACK frames can only request an increase in the
   acknowledgment rate, but cannot enforce it.

   Section 21.9 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] provides further guidance on peer
   denial of service attacks that could abuse control frames, including
   ACK frames as well as the newly herein specified ACK_FREQUENCY and
   IMMEDIATE_ACK frames, to cause disproportional processing costs
   without observable impact on the state of the connection.
   Especially, the IMMEDIATE_ACK frame does not only imply processing
   cost for receiving and processing the control frame itself but can
   also cause additional sending of packets.  However, in general, with
   this extension, a sender cannot force a receiver to acknowledge more
   frequently than the receiver considers safe based on its resource
   constraints.
